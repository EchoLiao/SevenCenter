This has only been tested on iOS 6.1 on an iPhone. SevenCenter (probably) only works on iPhones, on iOS 5 & iOS 6.

##License

SevenCenter is available under the MIT license. You may not publish the compiled source code as a package in Cydia.


##Set-Up Instructions

If you don't know how to compile and run this on your device then you probably shouldn't even attempt it :P

##Credits

Made by Jonas Gessner (in just a few hours :P). UIImage blurring is based on FXBlurView
